WIP... new project, not much to see here

# Nest

## What is it

Nest is (supposed to be) an experimental tool for writing bullet points with infinite nesting, and provide a different way to view and navigate.

Our thought process isn't linear, and I believe traditional tools limit how we structure ideas that are, in nature, nested.

When you take a lot of branches you need to be able to unwind and find yourself, in Nest you could start a task, that drives you into a nesting of 6 sub-tasks, and you finish the innermost you unwind to the parent one.

Unwinding is like popping an item off the stack.

You may ask: how is this different from a list where you only edit from the bottom?

The fact that this is a tree, and with infinite nesting you can take as many branches as you find necessary.

When you get different ideas, you can traverse to a parent node, anotate the idea, and then you traverse back (using selection history) to your previous location, this way, you set up that task for later when you do unwind.

You can also add N tasks as children to a node, setting them up in desired order, and so when you unwind you know what is the next one in that bucket.
